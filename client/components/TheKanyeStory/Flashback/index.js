          Flashback eight months to my first ever gig as an Indie Maker. A
          friend and I started a company selling canvas prints. It's the
          familiar novice story:
        </p>
        <li>1) Spend months in a hole perfecting and perfecting a website</li>
        <li>2) Never speak to any potential customers</li>
        <li>3) Never check to see if anyone actually wants the product</li>
        <li>
          4) Realise you have no idea who your customer is or where they hang
          out
        </li>
        <li>5) Realise you aren't solving any real problems</li>
        <li>
          7) Savour this moment. Savour the time when no one cared. Because it
          won't always be like this
        </li>
        <Image img={"140canvas"} alt={"140 Canvas"} />
        <p>
          So, what went wrong? Well, Marc Kholbrugge summarised the problem with
          my approach far better than I ever could.

          It sounds so simple when you read it but nearly every Indie Maker
          makes this mistake. This time around itâ€™s going to be different. I'm
          starting to learn. The old me would have build a whole dating site,
          crossed my fingers and hoped. But the new me is sharper, more
          thoughtful. I need to figure out if there's demand for this thing. and
          then I'll make it. I need to test the waters first.
