      It’s 1am. I’m lying in bed scrolling twitter. Reading the usual mindless
      shit. Getting my dopamine fix. “The Backstreet boys are back with a brand
      new sound.” I don’t care but I keep on scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read another headline. Then another. Then another. “There’s a dating
      site for straight Trump supporters”. Everyone’s on twitter’s getting
      angry. The media are loving it. It’s the perfect fodder to pump to the
      masses. It’s simple, it’s controversial, it’s crazy.

      I click on the website. It reminds me of the internet back in 05. But
      forget the website. Forget Donald Trump. There something here. Connect the
      dots. Elon Musk sold flamethrowers and made a million. Supreme sold bricks
      and made a million. Kanye wore the MAGA hat and sold a million. Good
      marketing is about doing things the suit wearers haven’t got the balls to
      pull off. It's about thinking like a little kid who’s imagination hasn’t
      been beaten out of him.
